Create a repository and upload to Github following a tutorial on Git and Github.

This tutorial covered the installation of Git and the Github Desktop app. It also covered the installation of Visual Studio Code and how to work with Github repositories locally.

The tutorial covered Pushing and Pulling of repositores, branches and merging, and how to roll back commits. 

Some git commands covered were *status*, *add*, *commit*, *diff*, *log*, *checkout*, *restore*, and *reset*.

Github is a great way to store and manage cloud-based code repositories and when used with **git** and VS Code it provides a great workflow for working locally with online repositories.
